## Course Details

A hands-on course providing a beginner-level introduction to [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) - one of the major programming paradigms that underpins a significant number of modern technology systems and frameworks, including CRM, ERP, AI and Big Data systems amongst others.

Please note that this course is delivered using the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language - however OOP can be implemented just as easily in other major programming languages such as Python.

## Prerequisites

* None

## Outcomes

A beginner level knowledge of the following fundamental concepts that underpin the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm:

* Classes
* Objects
* Methods
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction

## Local Development Environment
Please ensure that you have the following development tools installed in order to provision a local development environment to meet the minimum software requirements for this course. This section assumes that you have local administrative rights in order to install software on your local machine.

### Development Tools
* **Git** - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free, open source and distributed version-control system that enables projects to effectively manage source code and configuration for technical projects across technical teams and developers.

* **Java SE Development Kit (JDK)** - Java is a major general purpose programming language that is primarily used for object oriented programming (OOP). For the purposes of this course, we will be using the free and open source [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) implementation of Java 8. 

* **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for JVM programming languages including Java, Scala, Groovy and Kotlin, and provides built-in tools to support enterprise frameworks such as Spring, and mobile and web development. For the purposes of this course, we will be using the free Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA.

### Windows 10

* **OpenJDK 8** - Download and install the latest OpenJDK 8 MSI binary build from [https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download).  To confirm Java has been installed successfully, open [Command Prompt](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/) and execute the following command: ``` java -version ```. If successful, the version of Java should be displayed.

* **Git** - Download and install the latest official binary build from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

* **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** - Download and install the latest official Community edition binary build from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)

### MacOS

#### Homebrew
The easiest way to install Git and OpenJDK 8 on MacOS is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - a package manager for MacOS and Linux. To install Homebrew, open the [Terminal](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/) application and execute the following command:

```
> /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
> brew doctor
> brew update
```

#### Git
To install Git, open the [Terminal](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/) application and execute the following command:
```
> brew install git
```

#### OpenJDK 8
To install OpenJDK 8, open the [Terminal](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/) application and execute the following command:
```
> brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
> brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

To confirm Java has been installed successfully, execute the following command. If successful, the version of Java should be displayed.
```
> java -version
```

#### IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
Download and install the latest official Community edition binary build from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac).
